(* OCaml implementations of some generic search algorithms,
   including one using 'effect handlers'. *)

(* Daniel Hillerström, November 2018, based heavily on John Longley's
   implementation in SML. *)

(* We give four implementations of generic search using different methods
   and language features, all cast as instances of a signature GENERIC_SEARCH.
   Search spaces are hypercuboids of any dimension: e.g. the list [3,4,5,6]
   specifies the space of points (x0,x1,x2,x3) where the xi are natural numbers
   and x0<3, x1<4, x2<5, x3<6 (a space of size 3x4x5x6).
   Points themselves are represented by functions p : int->int
   (e.g. p i = xi for i=0,1,2,3).
